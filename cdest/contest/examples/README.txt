These files have the form '<file-prefix>.<extension>.example'.
The intension is to show the structure of the files (they are all
human readable).  Some may be used to save time during configuration
by avoiding repeated applications of a command in the CDX Control Panel.
Copy a file from here to the directory where needed leaving off the
'.example' after the <extension>.  For example:

  cp players.db.example ../../src-lig/players.db
  cp Parameters.txt.example ..../src-lig/Parameters.txt
  cp contest-setup.example ../contest-setup.txt
  cp Parms.example ../../Contestants/franco/Parms
