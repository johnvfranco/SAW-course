This is the source directory of the non-graphical version of the Scorer for Linux.
This version is strictly command-line controlled and does not include
the CDX Control Panel nor the Configurator but all the controlling commands
available in the Control Panel are implemented in this version.

To compile sources to a jar archive type 'make' and hit return.
To run the Scorer from this directory use './run' and return.
You can also change directory to 'cdest' and run './cdx-lin.run'
