The sub-directories in this directory demonstrates how the Galois
tools:
   - cryptol and SAW
   
combined with yosys can be used to formally verify whether two
combinatorial Verilog designs are equivalent (FEV = Formal Equivalence
Verification).

The same method can be used for VHDL if you have the licenced version
of yosys or use the ghdl compiler to translate the VHDL to Verilog
when possible.

More examples to be added also for sequential Verilog
